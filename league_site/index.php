    <p1>The construction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002.
        Bahrain had fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage a F1 race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix.
        The race has been held in every Formula One season since 2004, with the exception of 2011, due to the 2011 Bahraini uprising.
        The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari.
        The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari.
        Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari.
        Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015.
        Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018.
        Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five.
        The 2022 round was won by Charles Leclerc, giving the Scuderia Ferrari their record seventh Bahrain Grand Prix victory. The most recent edition, held in 2023, was won by Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing,
         their first Bahrain Grand Prix victory in over ten years.
        The 2010 edition of the race saw a different circuit configuration used for the Grand Prix.
        The "Endurance Circuit" layout was used instead of the "Grand Prix Circuit" layout, extending the lap length to 6.299 km (3.914 mi).
        The track was planned to revert back to its original layout for the 2011 edition, and did so for the 2012 edition.</p1>
